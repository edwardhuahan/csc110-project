People with cancer don’t pass their cancer onto others

With limited beds to treat people, which one is the greatest threat to public (rather than individual) health?

Nothing at all in place to protect them. Children get covid, long covid and 119 have died. Children can’t vote so the government don’t care."

Does he say anything when the government effectively take away the right to protest? Most ppl realise that wearing a mask and a bit of social distancing is sensible during a pandemic.

Since then, immunity (prevention) was changed to TREATMENT to a disease.
Why couldn't the COVID shot be called a pretreatment shot instead? Probably because they wouldn't be able to mandate it. https://t.co/8c9cptivHU"

There is an average of 1 person per hospital with Covid. No hospital is in worse shape than it was in 2001. Some better. You will eventually be investigated
